What is PEPPOL?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture hero_text_first_card %}
PEPPOL allows fast, efficient, and borderless commercial exchanges.

PEPPOL document specifications encompass global business processes by
standardizing the way information is structured and exchanged.

In addition to the standard formats and to a secure network, PEPPOL provides
the governance to make it work, through binding agreements that guarantee the
compliance of the parties involved.

The single Peppol Access Point for the PA
{% endcapture %}

{% capture hero_text_second_card %}
The single Peppol Access Point for the PA was created by the National Peppol
Authority to support the transmission of electronic orders in the first
instance on the Peppol network. It is a service, qualified in the Peppol
network and integrated with NSO - Nodo Smistamento Ordini, which has the task
of transmitting to economic operators certified on the Peppol network an
electronic order sent by an Italian Public Administration via traditional
channels (PEC, FTP and WS9) to NSO, and deliver to the NSO itself the result of
the transmission to Peppol of the document received from the Access Point of
the recipient economic operator (Corner 3).
