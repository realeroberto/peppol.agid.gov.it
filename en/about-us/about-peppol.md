PEPPOL document specifications encompass global business processes by
standardizing the way information is structured and exchanged.

Roberto Reale and Carmen Ciciriello contributed to the development and
coordination of PEPPOL at the EU level and to the establishment of the
Italian PEPPOL Authority.

In addition to the standard formats and to a secure network, PEPPOL provides
the governance to make it work, through binding agreements that guarantee the
compliance of the parties involved.

PEPPOL is not a platform. PEPPOL is an enabler. Any organization can operate on
the PEPPOL open network through a PEPPOL certified service provider.

No more closed systems. By connecting to PEPPOL you can have business
relationships with any PEPPOL-enabled organization anywhere in the world.

PEPPOL's approach reduces costs, fosters growth, drives innovation and healthy
competition.

PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line) was born in 2008 as a pilot
project funded by the European Commission to identify a set of infrastructural
elements and technical specifications capable of enabling and facilitating
e-procurement processes.
